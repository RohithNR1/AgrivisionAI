Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.

## Frontend: Chatbot + TTS Integration

This frontend includes the AgriVision Chatbot component which integrates with the Flask backend API at `http://localhost:5000/api/chat`.

- The chatbot UI (`src/components/Chatbot.tsx`) sends JSON `{ message, language?, tts? }` to the backend.
- The language dropdown supports: Auto-detect, English (`en`), Hindi (`hi`), Kannada (`kn`), Telugu (`te`), Tamil (`ta`).
- When `tts` is enabled the backend returns `audio` (base64 MP3) which the frontend will automatically play.

Running locally:

1. Start the backend (from project root):
```powershell
& .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
..\venv\Scripts\python.exe ..\backend.py
```
2. Start the frontend:
```powershell
cd vision-agri-care-main
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you want production-quality TTS, run the separate `tts_service` (see project root README). The frontend does not call the TTS service directly — the backend will proxy TTS requests when `TTS_SERVICE_URL` is set.
